                quality Mexican
                Food that’s been hard to beat for over two decades. Since the restaurant’s inception, founders Vincent
                and Carmen Lopez have used their vast collection of traditional family recipes as the cornerstone of the
                Carmelita’s experience. They, along with their son’s Michael and Ray, continue to work hard to keep the
                traditions of fresh, authentic, Mexican food and great customer service, a reality.</p>
